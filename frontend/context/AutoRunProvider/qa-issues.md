- Z-index of the popup is too high, so it gets overlapped with the modal.
- This is my personal taste but I'd keep the list order strict when you add/remove agents here and there. For example, Initially I have agents A, B, C, D. If I exclude A and then add it, I have this sequence: B, C, D, A. Personally I'd prefer it to always be A, B, C, D. I'd wait what others think about this before actioninig.
- I can exclude the agent when it’s loading. (It can be OK but not sure how it'll then work)
- To have a 30 seconds pause after the toggle is turned on (user can exclude / include agents) then start the actual auto-run.
