- This is my personal taste but I'd keep the list order strict when you add/remove agents here and there. For example, Initially I have agents A, B, C, D. If I exclude A and then add it, I have this sequence: B, C, D, A. Personally I'd prefer it to always be A, B, C, D. I'd wait what others think about this before actioninig.

- I can exclude the agent when it’s loading. (It can be OK but not sure how it'll then work)

- To have a 30 seconds pause after the toggle is turned on (user can exclude / include agents) then start the actual auto-run.

- there’s a major UX problem with Auto-run: when Auto-run starts an agent, the UI automatically navigates/switches to that running agent.	Example: If I’m viewing Optimus rewards, I get redirected to Polystrat just because it started running.

- we should also exclude not fully onboarded agents from the list. for me optimus is not onboarded

- Annoying issue: I was on polystrat, clicked Auto-run toggle & enabled it, now suddenly I am switched to agentsfun, what and why?

- After auto-run is enabled, the agent which started running should be disabled from the auto-run list to be excluded.
