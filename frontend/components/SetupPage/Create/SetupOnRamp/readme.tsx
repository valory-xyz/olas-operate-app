/**
 * TODO
 *
 * Step 1: Buy crypto for fiat
 * - wait for the event to be emitted and wait for the transaction to be confirmed
 * - If failed: show the setup as failed and maybe add "Retry" button??
 * - what happens if we close the window when widget is visible
 * - how to pass the ongoing changing amount to the transak widget?
 * - TODO: add a logger on all events.
 *
 * Step 2: Swap funds
 * - TODO: ask Jose on how to swap funds
 * - TODO: what if there is an error in swapping?
 *
 * Step 3: Create Master Safe
 * - Same as bridging funds (combine the steps 3 and 4)
 *
 * Step 4: Transfer funds to the Master Safe
 * - Same as bridging funds (combine the steps 3 and 4)
 *
 * API Key: ask Iason to create company account.
 *
 * Security:
 * - keep API key safe and do not expose it in client-side code
 *
 * Doubts:
 * - Staging vs Production
